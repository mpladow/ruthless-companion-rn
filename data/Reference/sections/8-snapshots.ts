			<p>If one of your characters is about to be fired upon or
			engaged in Fisticuffs by an enemy character, you can try
			to “get the draw on him” and shoot first or duck for
			cover. You succeed by playing any card from your hand
			that is higher than the card the opponent used for
			initiative at the start of the current turn. Opponents
			cannot play a card of their own to react. Snap Shots are
			a single, un-aimed shot. Ducking for cover allows you to
			move 3” toward nearby cover.</p>

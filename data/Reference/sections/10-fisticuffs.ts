			<h1>Fisticuffs</h1>
			<p>Fisticuffs is not an action. It is resolved when two
			opposing characters are moved into base-to-base
			contact. Both players immediately select one card from
			their hand. The highest score wins. The loser is pushed
			back 2” and suffers two wounds on the hit table.</p>
			<p>If you cannot play a card or remain Unconscious from a
			prior Severe Wound, you lose automatically.</p>

			<p>Some character traits may offer a bonus in combat, and
			being mounted always adds +1 to the value of your
			Fisticuffs card. If a “2” is played, it’s a “Low Blow,” and
			the 2 card wins if it matches the opponent card’s suit!</p>
